Notes for moving from week 1 to week 2.

Outline:
- First, questions about anything from last tutorial?
- Questions about any Unity related subjects? What do you need to work on in your projects right now?
- Make sure we're working on branch week-1 (and branch to something else so we leave the branch-1 version)

- Create bool to flip player rotation
- Check flip whenever player moves
- Create player punch animation
- Hook up button (click or something) to make player punch
- Create an empty object and add a collider to it
- In the animation, make the gameobject with the collider enable
- Make a square sprite on that gameobject so that we can see when the collider is enabled
- Test it!
- Add an attacker script to the gameobject with the collider
- OnTriggerEnter/Stay method
	- but wait! how do we know if it's the enemy's hitbox that enters
- Make an enemy script
	- give it health
	- method to damage enemy, debug log
- Back in attacker class, TryGetComponent<Enemy> on the collision object
- Damage it
- Debug log it
- Test it!

- Create enemy movement:
	- simple enemy move towards player
	- stop when near player
	- then, enemy lifts some sprite
	- then, enemy attacks player with sprite
- player script needs to have health

- Other things we should do?
	- pausing
	- events triggering when player walks somewhere (like player picking up an object or a door opening)
	- walls (simple, add colliders)
	- Suggestions?

- Cover UI: player healthbar, xp bar,
