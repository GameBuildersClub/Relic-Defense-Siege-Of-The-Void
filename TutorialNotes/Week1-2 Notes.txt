Week 1-2 Notes:

How to punch:

- Animation to punch (add sprite for punch and sprite for effect)
- Button to activate animation
- Add transition from run to punch so that it works while running
- No punching while moving! Add check to see if in animator state, no moving.
- Collider for player punch hitbox
- Hitbox script (OnTriggerEnter)
- Debug log when hitbox overlaps
- Add a basic square with a collider (named enemy) to check collisions
- Add the enemy animation to the square
- Add an enemy script (damage method)
- From hitbox script call damage if tryget works
- Yay!

- Enemy animation for punch (add basic circle for hitbox, enable hitbox in animation)
- Add collider for circle
- Same steps as player hitbox... create an enemy hitbox and check for player
- Add health and damage function to playercontroller
- Make it so animation is always playing
- Test!

- Probably need workaround for bug: method for hitting all overlapping players, call method in animation, don't disable hitbox in animation, only change sprite in animation)
- Check for work!

- Move enemy to player
